				“Current Sanitation methods convert pollution to disaster and lead to major problems faced by society today, such as; water pollution, water scarcity, loss of soil fertility, global warming, poor economy, poor health and loss of life”, stated Dr Steven Esrey &amp; Ingvar Anderson of WHO in 1999. The methods continue to be the same, even in 2014!

				<span style="font-weight: bold;">Onenature Waste Development (OWD)</span> (India Patent appln. no. 2135/MUM/2011)is a new invention for Water Harvesting and Sanitation to resolve the said problems. In OWD, waste is neutralized using additives and further treated in a bioreactor which integrates and treats inorganic and organic waste instead of decomposing it, thus no foul gases, unclean water or acids are released. Additives and bioreactor are made from inorganic waste and have a lush green garden on the surface. OWD for STP treats wastewater by filtering out particles, utilizing chemicals and nutrients, and acting as a site for destroying pathogens. OWD process is simpler, more economical to set up and maintain, more energy &amp; space efficient, healthier and more ecological compared to alternatives.

				<span style="font-weight: bold;">Applications of OWD:</span>
				Specific versions of OWD can be used for enhancement of air, water and soil by the management and treatment of solid and liquid waste of municipalities, communities, slums, hospitals, hotels, industries, food processing units, raw water, swimming pools, polluted water bodies &amp; degraded lands etc. Even potable water can be generated from waste water. It can be made for any capacity.

					<li>The sewage is being distributed on this Bioreactor which has a grass garden on the surface and a 1.5 meter deep tank filled with granular media below it. The sewage gets treated and aerated as it seeps down in about 7 minutes. The process is odorless.</li>
					<li>
						A small recycle feed of treated sewage is fed into the Sewage tank to enhance the treatment and highly reduce the sewage smell. The fresh sewage is pumped onto the Bioreactor.
					</li>
					<li>
						In this STP, the sewage is converted to an excellent liquid fertiliser, grass and some bio- mineral fertiliser. By slightly modifying the media, the sewage can even be converted to drinking water instead of liquid fertiliser.
					</li>
				</ol>

				Other embodiments of OWD can be used for solid waste, hospital waste, industrial waste etc. OWD is ecological, efficient and economical. It’s easy to construct, operate and maintain. OWD can beautifully replace the bulky complicated conventional STPs which are operationally and environmentally hazardous, highly inefficient, extremely expensive, not possible for small communities and very difficult and expensive to operate and maintain. They are very stinky and have very harmful and polluting products - liquid, solid and gases.
