				“Current Sanitation methods convert pollution to disaster and lead to major problems faced by society today, such as; water pollution, water scarcity, loss of soil fertility, global warming, poor economy, poor health and loss of life”, stated Dr Steven Esrey &amp; Ingvar Anderson of WHO in 1999. The methods continue to be the same, even in 2014!

				<span style="font-weight: bold;">Onenature Waste Development (OWD)</span> (India Patent appln. no. 2135/MUM/2011)is a new invention for Water Harvesting and Sanitation to resolve the said problems. In OWD, waste is neutralized using additives and further treated in a bioreactor which integrates and treats inorganic and organic waste instead of decomposing it, thus no foul gases, unclean water or acids are released. Additives and bioreactor are made from inorganic waste and have a lush green garden on the surface. OWD for STP treats wastewater by filtering out particles, utilizing chemicals and nutrients, and acting as a site for destroying pathogens. OWD process is simpler, more economical to set up and maintain, more energy &amp; space efficient, healthier and more ecological compared to alternatives.

				<span style="font-weight: bold;">Applications of OWD:</span>
				Specific versions of OWD can be used for enhancement of air, water and soil by the management and treatment of solid and liquid waste of municipalities, communities, slums, hospitals, hotels, industries, food processing units, raw water, swimming pools, polluted water bodies &amp; degraded lands etc. Even potable water can be generated from waste water. It can be made for any capacity.
