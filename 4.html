		During 1998-2000, after an in-depth R&amp;D, done internationally, we found that Asbestos Cement Water supply Pipes and roofing sheets are far more eco-friendly and occupationally safe than their alternatives like metals and plastics. The US EPA Ban of 1990 on these products was reverted by US Courts in 1991 itself due to the said reason. However due to lobbies and lopsided media coverage, the reversal of this Ban is almost unknown till date. Asbestos Cement is banned or being banned in many countries. This ban was coming in India in that period but was reverted due to our efforts at the National and State levels.

			We made an exhaustive comparative analysis of water supply pipelines on several relevant counts like economy, efficiency, ecological implications, etc. and have shared it with some decision-making bodies. The preferred technology is Eco-Friendly Asbestos Cement (AC) technology.
		</li>
		<li>
			We countered the Substandard Industry lobby at the BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) for 3 years. With persistence we were able to rectify and revise the degraded Indian standards for AC pressure pipes in India, to ensure world-class quality and their optimum field performance.

			Following our successful efforts in favour of Eco-Friendly Asbestos Cement and its technical upgradation in India, during 1998-2000;a. State Governments like Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu reverted the ban (or potential ban) on Asbestos Cement (AC) Pipes.b. They changed their buying specifications/preferences for ISO Asbestos Cement (AC) Pipes.c. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu successfully started using ISO + 5 Kg AC Pipes for water supply since 1999 and saved crores of rupees. The estimated savings for Maharashtra pending schemes of Rs. 2000 crores was about Rs. 700 crores. During our dispute with WTO, their top level officials admitted that their decision of 2001, against Asbestos trade, was hurried and wrongful because it was taken under tremendous lobby pressure of US and Europe.

			The Indian partner of ILO; The Directorate General, Factory Advice and Labour Institutes (DGFASLI), alongwith Mr. Joy Manglani, in 2009, prepared a booklet on Eco-Friendly and occupationally safe production and use of Asbestos Cement products. The Asbestos Cement Industry lobby stopped its publication with a fear that Asbestos Cement Industry may get opened up after this publication and they would have to face tough competition.
